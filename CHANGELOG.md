# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses beta semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.4-beta.1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Reworked first-visit onboarding into a guided introduction with settlement search, manual fallback and optional Sync setup.

## [1.0.3-beta.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Reduced false 429 refresh warnings by letting cached and deduplicated BitJita proxy responses bypass the local proxy rate limit.

## [1.0.2-beta.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added a public Discord invite button in the sidebar so visitors can join the settlement community.

### Changed

- Updated public domain references and footer copyright text for `claim-monitor.com`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Production refreshes for very large settlements by moving roster lookup to the server instead of posting the full member list from the browser.
- Clarified refresh warning copy so partial Production failures are not presented as a generic BitJita outage.

## [1.0.1-beta.1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Converted the public app flow to browser-local settlement setup with shared server-side history refreshes keyed by settlement ID.
- Replaced hardcoded active region dropdowns with a shared BitJita-backed active-region source for Map, Market tools and Public Craft Finder.
- Updated Production status so crafts can show active when their progress increased during the latest refresh, even if BitJita contribution timestamps lag.

### Removed

- Removed public access to login, admin, Discord bot configuration and bot dashboard source files.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Reworked the floating utility buttons into a compact footer-aware dock with clearer icon contrast and tidier notification badges.
- Reworked the Construction page into a clearer gather-first view with compact material rows, project filters and a consolidated missing-materials list.
- Moved Admin out of the main sidebar into the floating utility dock and User Settings to keep normal navigation focused on player-facing pages.
- Hid Admin shortcuts from the floating dock and User Settings unless an administrator session is active.
- Removed the listed-time helper notice from Market listings to reduce visual clutter.

### Removed

- Removed inactive pin/watchlist controls from Production, Market pricing and Browser Settings until a visible pinned-items surface is rebuilt.

## [0.9.27-beta.1] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- Updated toast notifications to use the current dashboard-style colours and show item thumbnails with tier-coloured borders when item data is available.
- Changed Construction progress bars to show material contribution completion instead of build effort progress.
- Reworked the main sidebar into grouped collapsible sections to reduce navigation clutter.
- Added a sidebar Discord sign-in link and changed the first-visit sign-in prompt to use the same direct OAuth link as User Settings.
- Removed the visible Quick Find button from the sidebar while keeping keyboard command search available through Ctrl+K.
- Added an in-app BitJita data warning banner when refreshes fail or production craft details only partially update.
- Improved BitJita HTTP error messages so temporary API failures are shown as readable app alerts instead of raw endpoint errors.

## [0.9.26-beta.1] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- Updated Leaderboard cards and filter controls to match the current dashboard-style card surfaces and metric styling.
- Renamed the Leaderboard summary metric from Recorded Progress to Recorded Contribution.

## [0.9.25-beta.1] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Added a Contribution Leaderboard page that records observed settlement craft contributions by member and profession.
- Added a first-visit Discord sign-in prompt so users can link their character and save server-side preferences when Discord login is enabled.

### Changed

- Grouped utility pages under a Tools flyout in the sidebar.
- Reworked Browser Settings into focused sections for account, theme, preferences, and local data.
- Added endpoint-specific BitJita proxy cache policies so stable catalog data is cached longer while live settlement data stays short-lived.
- Added a server-side Dashboard data aggregate so the Dashboard loads its live BitJita bundle through one local endpoint instead of many browser proxy requests.
- Moved dashboard/member/map player detail loading behind one cached local endpoint to reduce browser request fan-out.
- Consolidated local history polling onto the main app refresh cycle to avoid duplicate background timers per page.
- Added an Admin setup checklist and a clearer Discord bot workflow summary to make setup gaps easier to find.
- Improved admin success/error feedback and changed destructive admin/bot actions to require typed confirmation.
- Added a focused Phase 6 stylesheet module for setup, workflow and mobile shell polish.
- Updated local development and agent documentation for the current maintained app and smoke-server workflow.

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate Discord craft-start notifications when BitJita reports the same active craft with a different current crafter.
- Fixed the sidebar Tools menu visibility, changed it to an overlay so it no longer compresses the sidebar, and moved Browser Settings navigation to top tabs so the dialog no longer stays oversized on short sections.

### Removed

- Removed historical Replit export artifacts from the active workspace.

## [0.9.24-beta.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate Discord craft-start notifications when BitJita changes a craft entity ID, Discord delivery is skipped or fails, or a craft briefly disappears from polling.

## [0.9.23-beta.1] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Improved the main app footer spacing, support button styling, and sidebar collapse animation.

## [0.9.22-beta.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Added a Market Buy Order Finder tab for finding active regional buy orders by item, with best price, total demand, total value, and order details.
- Added a Craft Calculator page that uses BitJita recipe data to calculate source materials and step-by-step crafting chains.
- Added recipe route selectors to the Craft Calculator when BitJita exposes multiple valid recipes for an output or intermediate material.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Buy Order Finder region filter so returned buy orders are locally filtered to the selected region even if the API returns a broader result set.
- Fixed Craft Calculator source-material chains for items whose production recipe is exposed through BitJita output-helper items, such as wood logs from trunks.

## [0.9.21-beta.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Fixed the footer support button so it renders reliably without depending on the third-party Buy Me a Coffee embed script.

## [0.9.20-beta.1] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- Switched the repository license from PolyForm Noncommercial to AGPL-3.0-only and added explicit notice/trademark guidance for attribution and branding.

## [0.9.19-beta.1] - 2026-06-08

- Updated Market live listings to label the per-item amount as Unit Price and show a separate Total Price column for the full listing value.

## [0.9.18-beta.1] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Added Void, Ocean, and Crimson browser theme presets.

### Changed

- Updated the Violet browser theme description to avoid research-specific wording.

## [0.9.17-beta.1] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

- Continued Phase 4 frontend modularization by moving shared formatting, item/equipment normalization, owner labels, browser persistence hooks, badges, item displays, metric components, API polling hooks, and app data normalization into focused modules.
- Moved the Members, Professions, Construction, Research, Region, and Sync views into dedicated page modules and removed the dead legacy Overview implementation from the main app shell.

## [0.9.16-beta.1] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Added private settlement crafts to the Production page when BitJita returns them through member craft data, with private craft badges and a browser setting to hide them.

### Fixed

- Fixed Production current-crafter chips so member names and counts render as one clean pill.

## [0.9.15-beta.1] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

- Improved BitJita proxy performance by sharing duplicate in-flight API requests and using a bounded short-lived cache for repeated frontend refreshes.
- Reduced local history polling from three separate browser requests to one combined endpoint for market, activity, and snapshot history.
- Reduced BitJita player-detail fan-out by only loading per-member online/session details on Dashboard, Members, and Map pages where that data is displayed.
- Reduced local history polling payloads by loading market history only on the Market page and trend snapshots only on the Dashboard while keeping activity notifications available everywhere.
- Reduced main BitJita refresh fan-out by loading heavier settlement endpoints only on the pages that display them, while keeping shared claim, member, and craft data available for app-wide shell features and production notifications.
- Limited browser snapshot writes to the Dashboard page so snapshots are recorded only when the full snapshot inputs are loaded.
- Capped paginated BitJita listing and region fetches to avoid large bursts of simultaneous requests while preserving complete results.
- Capped Production passive-craft member lookups to avoid refreshing every member request at once while preserving the same passive craft results.
- Moved Dashboard activity summaries and treasury net calculations server-side so non-Activity pages can refresh with smaller local history payloads.
- Split Discord bot dashboard sections into lazy-loaded chunks so ordinary app pages download less admin-only UI code up front.
- Reduced background local-history polling on non-Activity pages while keeping Activity and Market refreshes more responsive.
- Capped player-detail and craft-contribution refreshes to avoid large simultaneous BitJita request bursts while preserving per-item fallback behavior.
- Capped market sale/cancellation reconciliation checks during polling so closed or changed listings no longer trigger unbounded BitJita trade-history lookups.
- Reduced non-Activity local-history payload sizes while keeping the full retained history available on the Activity page.
- Split production frontend bundles into dedicated vendor chunks for React, icons, and other dependencies so repeat visits can reuse cached framework code.
- Capped combined local-history activity limits server-side so oversized history requests cannot create unnecessarily large database reads.
- Added a cached local Map catalog endpoint so resources and creatures load through one reusable server-side aggregation instead of separate browser BitJita requests.
- Capped pinned market watch price-history refreshes so watchlist items no longer request every tracked market price at once.
- Moved settlement member passive-craft summaries behind one cached local endpoint so the Production page no longer makes a separate browser BitJita request for every member.

## [0.9.9-beta.1] - 2026-06-07

### Security

- Added administrator roles and route-level permission checks for settings, data export, backups, analytics, linked accounts, Discord management, Discord moderation, and administrator account management.
- Preserved existing administrator access by migrating current admin users to the Owner role.

### Changed

- Added role selection and role editing to the Admin Console administrator management screen.

## [0.9.8-beta.1] - 2026-06-07

### Security

- Added baseline browser security headers for API, static frontend, file download, branding, and BitJita proxy responses.
- Added route-specific request body limits so oversized public and admin requests are rejected predictably.
- Added route-class rate limiting for auth, Discord OAuth, analytics, Discord interactions, BitJita proxying, region lookups, and local snapshot collection.
- Hardened Discord OAuth state cookies with a server-side HMAC signature to reject tampered callback state.

### Fixed

- Improved oversized request handling so rejected bodies return `413` instead of a generic server error.

## [0.9.7-beta.1] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- Improved Production controls spacing so member, sorting, and crafter filters align cleanly.
- Redesigned Construction project cards to make required materials, storage, and missing quantities easier to scan.
- Standardised Market tools layout so Live Listings, Analytics, and Price Finder keep a consistent height.
- Improved Admin status card spacing to better match the updated dashboard styling.

### Added

- Added crown styling beside the monitored settlement owner's member name where that user appears in the app.

### Fixed

- Prevented crown styling from being applied to owners of other settlements in regional views.

## [0.9.6-beta.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- Fixed Discord character-link selection so member names are shown and submitted instead of raw player IDs.

## [0.9.5-beta.1] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added optional Discord sign-in for app users.
- Added Discord-to-character link requests with admin approval from the Admin page.
- Added Discord mod-log notifications when users request a character link review.
- Added signed-in account settings save/load so users can keep browser preferences on the server.

### Changed

- Improved the browser-local theme editor with clearer labels, a collapsible advanced editor, a closer app preview, and dedicated page-gradient controls.
- Expanded the browser-local theme editor with card surface, card heading, metric value, icon background, active highlight, active border, and hover border controls.
- Changed the theme editor entry point so the Custom preset opens the advanced theme controls instead of using a separate Edit Theme button.

### Fixed

- Fixed theme controls so the sidebar colour and advanced colour inputs update the actual rendered app surfaces.
- Fixed Dashboard and shared KPI cards so theme changes affect card gradients, card titles, metric values, icons, active states, and hover borders.
- Fixed browser-local themes so shared main-app cards, filters, tables, controls, and page panels outside Dashboard also consume the selected theme colours.

## [0.9.2-beta.1] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added a browser-local theme editor to User Settings with presets, grouped colour controls, live preview, and reset-to-default.

### Changed

- Restyled the Inventory page with the new Dashboard visual language, including a Dashboard-style topbar, summary cards, compact filters, polished core material cards, and cleaner container panels.

## [0.8.62-beta.1] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

### Added

- Added a new Dashboard page as the default home page, styled separately from the existing Overview page to more closely match the supplied command-centre mockup.

- Restyled Overview around a sharper blue-black dashboard palette inspired by the new mockup direction.
- Renamed the unclear market presence KPI to Trade Listings and kept the metric limited to current settlement listing counts.

## [0.8.56-beta.1] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- Refactored main-app API parsing for supply runway and Construction project materials into tested shared helpers.

### Fixed

- Fixed Overview supply runway parsing so it accepts both documented and currently observed BitJita run-out field names.

## [0.8.52-beta.1] - 2026-06-03

### Changed

### Changed

- Reworked the Discord Bot Control dashboard into sectioned categories for setup, notifications, channels, roles, tests and diagnostics.

## [0.8.13-beta.1] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Map focus from Public Craft Finder is now stored per browser and reflected in the page URL, so refreshing the Map page keeps the selected settlement/location.

### Changed

- Craft-start Discord notifications are now only marked as delivered after Discord accepts the message, so permission failures can be retried.
- Admin now shows the latest Discord notification delivery status, including channel errors such as missing access.

## [0.8.5-beta.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added a floating Admin save prompt that appears when settings have unsaved changes, with Save and Revert actions.

## [0.7.5-beta.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Gear preset cards now show only equipped items instead of rendering BitJita's empty placeholder slots as visible equipment slots.

## [0.7.4-beta.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Replaced the manual local settings profile dropdown with automatic browser-specific settings.
- Pinned overview items, filters, density and notification preferences now persist in local browser storage without requiring analytics cookie consent.
- Added a browser settings reset action for clearing local app preferences without touching admin settings or settlement data.

### Fixed

## [0.7.1-beta.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Member details now load BitJita equipment presets and show each available gear preset rather than only the currently equipped set.

- Added a footer disclaimer for Clockwork Labs affiliation/trademark status and BitJita API data attribution.
- Member details now always show both gear preset slots, including an explicit not-reported state when BitJita does not return gear for a slot.
- Corrected gear preset mapping so the current equipment appears as Preset 1 and BitJita's saved alternate preset appears as Preset 2.

### Changed

- Renamed the Production passive-craft history panel to Member Passive Crafts and clarified that the API identifies the member, but not the settlement location where the craft occurred.

## [0.6.4-beta.1] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Storage movements are now collected by the background server poller and persisted in Activity history rather than fetched from every browser viewing Activity.
- Activity loads its locally stored feed every 10 seconds; its member selector roster updates separately without blocking timeline display.

## [0.6.3-beta.1] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Storage deposit and withdrawal entries now show the settlement container nickname when one is configured, falling back to its structure name.
- Added an Activity member selector for filtering attributed storage and market events by settlement member.

## [0.6.2-beta.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Activity storage movements are now loaded from the monitored settlement's known storage structures rather than each member's global storage history.
- Storage activity excludes deployable containers such as carts, wagons, boats, ships and goats.

## [0.6.1-beta.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Price Finder recent trades now display buyers returned by BitJita's live price-history payload under `buyerUsername`, while retaining support for `purchaserUsername`.

## [0.6.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Overview watchlist for core materials, Price Finder items, and production crafts.
- Notification inbox retaining recent market and production alerts, with links back to the relevant page.

- The last visited page and Market tab are restored after refreshing the app.

## [0.4.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Historical confirmed-sale importing for current members' completed orders at the monitored settlement market, using BitJita order claim identity and completed trade fills.
- Dedicated `market_trades` persistence keyed by BitJita trade ID, so imported history is retained without duplication across polling runs.

### Changed

- Market Analytics now uses authoritative completed trade records for orders proven to belong to the monitored settlement market rather than importing unrelated member sales.
- On first successful collection for a member, completed sell orders belonging to this market are backfilled; later verified tracked sales are retained in the same trade history.
- Admin status now reports retained confirmed trades separately from listing lifecycle events.

## [0.3.1-beta.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Market collection now retrieves every listing page before reconciling closures, preventing listings beyond the first API page from being incorrectly marked removed.
- Market analytics now aggregate confirmed sales from retained database history, including when filtering by settlement member.
- Sale confirmation handles split fills of a listing instead of requiring one trade to cover the complete removed quantity, and does not reuse earlier fills for later drops.
- Snapshot writes are serialized and keep BitJita network requests outside the SQLite transaction.
- Region ranking collection now uses paginated, cached server-side enrichment with bounded detail lookups rather than repeated browser fan-out.

### Security

- Administrator-changing requests now require a same-origin session request token, and production rejects browser-submitted snapshots.
- Password hashing no longer blocks the Node event loop, and session lookup uses SHA-256 token hashes. Existing signed-in sessions expire after this update and administrators must sign in again.

### Added

- Tier badges across settlement views using the in-game tier colour palette, with translucent presentation in badges and the Professions heatmap.

- Member-based Production eligibility filtering from the Production page.
- Member profile sections for public Toolbelt profession tools and equipped gear.

- Floating help access on every page, including the current app version and direct documentation, changelog, bug-report, and feature-request links.
- Beta/work-in-progress notice in the global help panel.

### Changed

- Production eligibility now checks the selected member's public skill level and matching Toolbelt tool type.
- Production tool eligibility follows the one-tier allowance: a T1 tool can perform T2 crafts, T2 can perform T3 crafts, and so on; tool power determines effort contributed per action.
- Public Crafts defaults to all skills while retaining the monitored settlement region as the initial region filter.
- The Production member selector now lives on the Production page instead of the sidebar.
- Public Crafts has been moved from the Production page into its own `Public Craft Finder` navigation page.
- Supply runway on Overview now uses the API run-out timestamp and displays days and hours.
- Overview treasury information now presents the treasury balance and supply upkeep without treating supply upkeep as currency expenditure.
- Overview, Structures, Research, and Region have revised operational layouts with clearer summary hierarchy.
- Member details can be opened by clicking anywhere on the member row.
- Member passive crafts now resolve recipe placeholders to item names and present grouped recent output summaries; traveler tasks are labelled Quests without the redundant level column.
- Inventory core material cards now count finished stock only and filter the visible container contents when selected.
- The former Skills page is now Professions: its primary summaries and heatmap use API-classified professions, with Adventure skills displayed separately.
- Profession heatmap headings now use full horizontal labels with wider sortable columns for readability.
- Profession summary columns have dedicated header sizing to prevent sort controls overlapping their labels.
- The Professions heatmap no longer creates an unnecessary vertical scrollbar; it scrolls horizontally only when required by the wider columns.
- Profession table columns were compacted to fit standard 1080p desktop widths without a horizontal scrollbar.
- Region now explains that the Close Settlements panel lists settlements nearest to the monitored settlement.
- Research no longer presents an active/in-progress technology because settlement technology unlocks are instant.

### Fixed

- Profession tools were incorrectly read from equipped hand slots; they are now sourced from the public Toolbelt inventory returned by the BitJita API.
- Selected-member Production cards no longer flash into a pending Toolbelt-check state during each background refresh.
- Passive craft recipe templates now resolve numbered placeholders such as tanning recipes returned as `Tan {1}`.
