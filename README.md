# BitCraft Claim Monitor

BitCraft Claim Monitor is a settlement operations dashboard built around the public [BitJita API](https://bitjita.com/docs/api). It combines live settlement information with locally persisted market and activity history, providing one place to check supplies, members, professions, skills, production, storage, research, trade, and regional context.

The application is currently in beta and under active development. Versioning follows semantic versioning with a beta pre-release suffix while features and data presentation continue to evolve.

The maintained application is in [`apps/bitcraft-local`](./apps/bitcraft-local). Historical Replit export artifacts have been removed from the active workspace so new development stays focused on the maintained app.

## What It Does

- Displays live public data for a selected BitCraft settlement.
- Refreshes live views automatically at a configurable interval without clearing visible content during background refreshes.
- Records market listings, completed member trades, market events, activity events, and snapshots in a local SQLite database.
- Imports retained confirmed-sales history from BitJita completed trades, with settlement-member filtering.
- Helps players find large public crafts for skill XP and navigate directly to their locations on the world map.
- Displays lightweight in-app notifications for new listings, confirmed sales, and settlement craft queue changes while the dashboard is open.
- Provides a floating help panel on every page with version, documentation, changelog, and issue-reporting links.
- Supports opt-in first-party usage analytics with an in-app cookie notice and privacy controls.
- Prompts each visitor to choose a settlement on first visit; no settlement is selected by default.
- Optionally embeds the visitor's BitCraft Sync board for material planning and shared goals.
- Stores visitor preferences, including selected settlement and optional Sync URL, in the browser.

## Application Pages

### Dashboard

The command-center view for the monitored settlement:

- Settlement tier, region, owner, member count, structure count, and market listing count.
- Online member count and shortcuts into Members, Structures, and Market.
- Supply runway using the API run-out timestamp and the current hourly/daily supply upkeep.
- Treasury balance alongside the current supply upkeep and claimed tile count.
- Work queue summaries for production, construction, and research.
- Attention prompts for low supplies, active projects, and market state.

### Members

The public settlement roster and member detail view:

- Online/offline state and session or last-login information.
- Settlement roles and build/inventory permissions.
- Total recorded levels across professions and skills.
- Public member drill-down data including Toolbelt profession tools, currently equipped gear, buffs, housing, grouped passive craft output history, market collections, and quests when returned by the API.
- Selecting a member from the roster sets the Production eligibility filter; the selector on the Production page can switch or clear it at any time.

### Professions

A settlement-wide profession coverage dashboard:

- Profession-only level totals, highest-profession and top-member summaries.
- Profession focus view with average level, current best tier, and strongest members.
- Heatmap table covering the API `Profession` category.
- Separate Skills summary for the API `Adventure` category: Cooking, Construction, Taming, Slayer, Merchanting and Sailing.
- Sorting by member, profession total, highest profession, or a selected profession.

BitCraft profession tier display follows the game's level bands: T1 begins at level 0, T2 at level 20, T3 at level 30, and so on; a player is not shown as reaching T6 until level 60.

### Production

Settlement production and member passive output tracking:

- Current crafts at settlement structures.
- Output tier badges, effort applied, effort to craft, total XP, and XP remaining where supplied by the API.
- Configurable sorting, defaulting to highest tier first.
- Optional selected-member highlighting based on public skill levels and matching profession tools held in that member's public Toolbelt inventory; a tool can complete crafts up to one tier above its own, while tool power determines effort contributed per action.
- Recent contributor records.
- Recent public passive craft output aggregated for members in the monitored settlement, with resolved item names, member, structure, quantity, and completion status. BitJita does not identify where a passive craft occurred, so this is member history rather than settlement-location activity.
- Activity status based on contribution recency:
  - `Active now`: a contribution was received within the last five minutes.
  - `Paused`: progress exists, but no recent contribution was recorded.
  - `Queued`: no progress has been applied yet.
  - `Ready`: required effort is complete.

BitJita does not expose a live "player is holding the craft action now" flag. The five-minute activity window is a practical indicator based on the latest available contribution event.

### Public Craft Finder

- Public incomplete crafts across the world, intended to help players locate XP-grinding opportunities.
- Skill filter including `All Skills`.
- Region filter defaulting to the monitored settlement's region.
- Sortable results, initially ranked by remaining effort.
- Settlement, required skill level, available XP, owner, and clickable location.
- Clicking a location opens the Map page focused on the selected craft destination.

### Inventory

Storage and material visibility across settlement containers:

- Collapsible containers showing their stored item stacks.
- Filters for item name, container, type, tier, rarity, and building.
- Finished core material totals split by tier: ingots, planks, bricks, leather, and cloth. Raw ingredients and intermediate forms are excluded.
- Clickable core-material cards that filter the container list to stored stacks of the selected finished material.
- Item detail inspection for recipe and related public API data.

Container `volume` is intentionally not displayed: the available API value represents slot/container capacity rather than a meaningful total of occupied material volume.

### Construction

- Current construction projects.
- Progress for each active project.
- Required material comparison against currently stored inventory.
- A "What to Gather Next" summary for missing construction materials.

### Structures

- Settlement structures grouped by their operational category.
- Search and filtering for easier inspection of large settlements.
- Slot and station summaries for crafting, refining, storage, and housing.
- Structure details where supplied by BitJita.

The app uses `Structures` terminology because BitCraft data may classify containers and similar assets as buildings, while players commonly distinguish operational stations and settlement structures.

### Research

- Completed and available research lists.
- The page does not show an active research state because technology unlocks are immediate.
- Tier and name filtering.
- Supply cost visibility for available technologies when returned by the API.

### Market

**Live Listings**

- Current buy and sell listings.
- Filter by settlement member, item, tier, and rarity.
- Listing date and age when the BitJita listing timestamp is available.

**Analytics**

- Confirmed sales count, units sold, sales revenue, and average sale value.
- Best-selling items ranked by confirmed units sold.
- Revenue by day.
- Recent individual confirmed sales.

Sales analytics use completed BitJita sell trades only after completed order history identifies the monitored settlement as the listing claim. Trade fills are retained in the local database by trade ID. The first successful collection backfills available completed orders from this market for current settlement members, and later tracked sales continue to be recorded. Live Listings remains scoped to the monitored settlement and follows paginated BitJita responses so active listings outside the first page are not closed incorrectly.

**Price Finder**

- Type-ahead item lookup across the BitJita market catalogue.
- Region dropdown defaulting to the monitored settlement's region, with all-region and available-region options.
- BitJita completed-trade average prices over 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days.
- Suggested list price based on the most recent available average, alongside recent trades and volume for judgement.
- Pin useful market items to the Overview watchlist.

### Monitoring Experience

- Browser refresh restores the current page and applicable Market or Public Craft Finder context.
- `Ctrl+K` or `/` opens quick navigation for pages, Price Finder and settlement members.
- Overview watchlist pins finished core materials, market items and production crafts for regular checks.
- Notification inbox retains recent market and production alerts after toast messages disappear.
- Compact/comfortable density modes make long tables easier to scan on different displays.
- Background updates preserve visible page content and briefly highlight changing figures.

### Region

- Regional settlement ranking table with sortable columns.
- Rankings and summary statistics for the monitored settlement.
- Regional online and trade summaries when available.
- Nearby or comparable settlement information.

### Map

An embedded [BitCraft Map](https://bitcraftmap.com/) view:

- Tracks selected settlement members when live player data is available.
- Enables settlement and road layers by default.
- Displays a focused waypoint when opened from a Public Craft Finder location.
- Includes a link to open the current map view in a full browser tab.

### Sync

Embeds an optional [BitCraft Sync](https://bitcraftsync.app/) settlement board, used for shared materials, crafting goals, and shopping requirements.

If a visitor does not add a Sync URL during onboarding, the Sync page shows a compact optional form instead of requiring one.

### Activity

- Locally recorded settlement changes over time.
- Public API storage movement events limited to known containers belonging to the monitored settlement.
- Timeline cards identify named settlement containers for deposits and withdrawals when nickname data is available.
- Deployable storage, including carts, wagons, boats and similar mobile containers, is excluded.
- Filters for storage, treasury, supplies, market, members, and structures.
- Member filter for attributed storage and market actions; settlement-wide system events are shown only in the all-members view.
- Optional compact view to reduce repeated low-signal entries.
- Storage history is collected by the server in the background and read locally by browsers, avoiding slow container-log requests during page refreshes; the member filter roster is loaded separately without blocking the timeline.

### Public Version

This repository is the public-facing version of the monitor. It does not include admin pages, Discord login, the Discord bot dashboard, import/export settings, or server-side user accounts.

On first visit, the app requires the visitor to search for and choose a settlement. The optional BitCraft Sync URL can be provided during onboarding or later from the Sync page. Both values are stored locally in that browser.

Server-side SQLite history is shared by settlement ID. If Alice and Bob both track the same settlement, their browsers read the same market, activity, snapshot and contribution records instead of creating per-user duplicates.

### Privacy And Analytics

Analytics are disabled until a visitor explicitly selects **Accept Analytics** in the cookie notice or Privacy & Analytics dialog. The app remains fully usable when analytics are declined.

When accepted, first-party cookies store the user's consent and a random browser identifier for up to 180 days. The application records section page views, time spent in each section and high-level feature usage including Market tabs, Price Finder searches, member-details opening, Production eligibility filters, Public Craft Finder controls, map links, and Activity filters. Raw analytics events are retained for up to 90 days.

The app does not include typed search text, the optional BitCraft Sync URL, item IDs, item names, region query values, private credentials, or database contents in analytics events. Visitors may withdraw permission at any time through **Privacy & Analytics**, which removes the analytics browser identifier.

## Data Sources And Persistence

### Public Live Data

Live game data is read from the public BitJita API through the application's same-origin proxy:

```text
/api/bitjita/* -> https://bitjita.com/api/*
```

The dashboard uses endpoints for claims, members, citizens, structures, inventories, construction, research, crafts, markets, player information, storage logs, region status, and trade summaries.

See [`BITJITA_API_AUDIT.md`](./BITJITA_API_AUDIT.md) for the endpoint audit performed during development.

### Local Database

The Node server owns a SQLite database called `bitcraft-local.sqlite`.

It records:

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `snapshots` | Settlement state captured over time |
| `market_listings` | Currently and previously observed listings |
| `market_events` | Listing lifecycle and reconciled trade events |
| `market_trades` | Imported, deduplicated completed sell trades for settlement members |
| `activity_events` | Settlement activity history |
| `analytics_events` | Consented first-party aggregate usage analytics |
| `public_claim_tracking` | Recently selected settlement IDs for shared refresh |
| `app_settings` | Public app display and collection configuration |

Development default:

```text
apps/bitcraft-local/data/bitcraft-local.sqlite
```

Production default configured by the deployment service:

```text
/var/lib/bitcraft-claim-monitor/bitcraft-local.sqlite
```

The server records snapshots and settlement storage activity for recently selected settlements. Browser views read persisted Activity history from the local API rather than waiting for every storage API request.

## Tech Stack

- React and TypeScript frontend.
- Vite development/build toolchain.
- Node.js server using built-in `node:sqlite`.
- SQLite persistence.
- Caddy reverse proxy and HTTPS termination for VPS hosting.
- systemd application service for production.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node.js 24 or newer.
- Corepack/pnpm. The repository is configured for `pnpm@11.1.3`.

### Install

From the repository root:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install
```

### Run The Maintained App

```bash
corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/bitcraft-local run dev
```

Default development URLs:

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | `http://localhost:18428` |
| Local SQLite/API server | `http://127.0.0.1:18430` |

To use alternate ports in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PORT = "18433"
$env:LOCAL_API_PORT = "18434"
corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/bitcraft-local run dev
```

### Build Check

```bash
corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/bitcraft-local run build
```

### Isolated Development Database

To avoid writing test history into the default local database:

```powershell
$env:BITCRAFT_LOCAL_DATA_DIR = "C:\tmp\bitcraft-monitor-data"
corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/bitcraft-local run dev
```

## Configuration

Supported application server environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_HOST` | Host interface for production server | `127.0.0.1` |
| `APP_PORT` | Production HTTP port | `18430` |
| `LOCAL_API_PORT` | Development local API port | `18430` |

## VPS Deployment

The intended production setup is:

- Ubuntu VPS.
- Node.js 24.
- Application installed at `/opt/bitcraft-claim-monitor`.
- Persistent data at `/var/lib/bitcraft-claim-monitor`.
- systemd running the Node application on `127.0.0.1:18430`.
- Caddy serving `https://app.timbersteeltrade.com` as the public HTTPS domain, with `https://claim.timbersteeltrade.com` and `https://claim.hostred.co.uk` redirected to it.

Full first-time instructions are in [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

For a normal update after changes have been pushed to GitHub:

```bash
cd /opt/bitcraft-claim-monitor
sudo -u bitcraft git pull --ff-only
sudo -u bitcraft corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
sudo -u bitcraft corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/bitcraft-local run build
systemctl restart bitcraft-claim-monitor
systemctl status bitcraft-claim-monitor --no-pager -l
curl http://127.0.0.1:18430/api/local/health
```

The database directory is outside the Git checkout, so ordinary code updates do not erase accumulated market or activity history.

## Security Notes

- Gameplay information displayed by the dashboard comes from public BitJita endpoints.
- Do not commit `bitcraft-local.sqlite`, environment files containing secrets, or VPS backups.
- Keep the production Node process bound to localhost and expose it through HTTPS with Caddy.
- Back up the SQLite database separately from the Git repository.
